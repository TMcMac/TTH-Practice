Lists in python
      New list is created with brackers []
      "" is a string literal
      Newlist["Python", "JavaScript", "C"]
      You can create a list with list()
      	  for example: newlist = list("Hello")
	      result is newlist = ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
      List are mutable
      you can add to the end of the list with .append("The thing to be added")
      you can add to the front of the list with .insert(0, " ")
      you can add the contents of another list to you list with .extend(other_list)
      .pop() will take last item off the list and return it to you so you can have it in a var (LIFO), you can also use an index in pop.
      .copy will copy the list to your new list
      .split() can be called on a string to make it into a list
      turn a list into a string with .join()

Tuples
	tuples are immutable
	Best for set data, no need to change, iterate, and known size
	Use tuples for heterogeneous data and lists for homogeneous data
	Use tuples for faster and more efficient access
